            <div><p class="text"><h3>Importance of Forensic Science</h3>

            Forensic science is a discipline that applies scientific analysis to the justice system, often to help prove the events of a crime. 
            Forensic science comprises a diverse array of disciplines, from fingerprint and DNA analysis to anthropology and wildlife forensics. <br/> 

            
            
            <br/>
            Forensic science is a critical element of the criminal justice system. Common forensic science laboratory disciplines include forensic 
            molecular biology (DNA), forensic chemistry, trace evidence examination (hairs and fibers, paints and polymers, glass, soil, etc.), latent 
            fingerprint examination, firearms and toolmarks examination, handwriting analysis, fire and explosives examinations, forensic toxicology, 
            and digital evidence.   <br/>
            
            
            <br/>
            Its labs serve as a model for government forensic agencies at the federal, state and local levels.  
            The Department strives to set the global standard for excellence in forensic science and to advance the practice and use of forensic 
            science by the broader community. <br/>
        
        
            Forensic science is critical to an effective justice system, which in turn is a pillar of a civil society.  It is an interdisciplinary field 
            that includes chemistry as a foundational and integral component including during investigations at many agencies such as the FDA, EPA and 
            USDA in addition to the DOJ.<br/> 
            
            <br/>
            Physical evidence presented in courts is frequently analyzed using forensic science techniques that are often 
            grounded in chemical principles and methods. The credibility of the legal system critically depends on forensic tests that are consistent, 
            accurate, and scientifically valid. <br/>
            
            <br/>
            Consequently, it is of significant importance to the American Chemical Society (ACS) that best practices from chemistry are part of 
            how forensic science is carried out.Forensic science also plays a critically important role in other areas such as the investigation of 
            domestic and international incidents, U.S. national security, and ensuring public health and safety.<br/> 
            
            <br/>
            Investigating terrorist threats from chemical and biological agents, such as the 2001 anthrax attacks, requires novel methods of 
            evidence collection and innovative forensictechniques. Nuclear Forensics: A Capability at Risk, a report released in 2010 by the 
            National Academies, identified areas of concern for nuclear forensics that overlap with concerns raised about forensic science in 
            general. Strengthening the scientific foundations of forensic science will benefit these areas of public concern as well. <br/>

            <br/>
            ACS recognizes the importance of the Organization of Scientific Area Committees for Forensic Science (OSAC) under the National Institute 
            of Standards and Technology and the former National Commission on Forensic Science (NCFS) under the Department of Justice. The Commission 
            and OSAC made strides to strengthen and enhance forensic science.<br/> 
            
            <br/>
            The functions performed by NCFS were an important step in forensic science reform and, therefore, these functions should be reinstated as part 
            of the Executive Branch. ACS applauds the policy recommendation by NCFS and subsequent action by the Department of Justice (DoJ) to require 
            all DoJ forensic labs to acquire and maintain accreditation. <br/>
        
            <br/>
            During the 7th century, the concept of utilizing fingerprints as a means of identification was first established. According to historical 
            records, a street merchant was able to verify the identity of a particular customer who owed him money by capturing his fingerprints on a 
            bill. <br/>
            

            <br/>
            A judge accepted the prints as undeniable evidence, providing a very early example of forensic science in action. In 1659, the Merriam-Webster 
            Dictionary officially recognized and printed the word “forensic”. The term had been used in medical writings for many years, but until then was 
            not considered to be an “official” word in the English language. In modern times the term is well-known and part of everyday language. <br/>
            
            <br/>
            One of this science primary functions is to study DNA, the genetic coding found on all living things. DNA samples can be acquired 
            from any human or animal and then be tested, and compared to other samples for similarities. This process is highly respected, and 
            a major consideration for cases in which the identity of an individual must be established. <br/>
        
        
            <br/>
            Physical evidences are collected by investigators with the help of forensic team and they are very useful. After analysis, it becomes 
            easy to identify the criminal, the victim and the missing person. Experts make the picture of criminals on the basis of description 
            provided by victims and witnesses. This also helps in identifying criminals. In this way forensic report helps in court of justice. Whenever 
            a crime is occurred and eye witness is not available at the crime scene and also the criminal could not be located, then the fingerprints, 
            footprints, palm andsole prints, body prints, tool marks and trace marks of the criminal found at the crime scene can be analyzed with the 
            help of forensic science and which makes it easy to identify the criminal. <br/>
            
            <br/>
            It is with the help of forensic science that the criminals can be identified, detained and efforts can be made to punish them or take remedial 
            measures to change their behavior. Then only the victims may get justice and we can expect a peaceful society. <br/></p></div>
