                <h2>Forensic Science in Crime Investigation</h2>
                <p>Forensic science plays a crucial role in solving crimes and bringing justice to victims. Here are some of the technologies and methods used in forensic science:</p>

                    <h3>Ballistics Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Ballistics analysis is the examination of firearms and ammunition to determine their source and the path of 
                        the bullet. This is useful in solving crimes involving guns, such as homicides and armed robberies. 
                        Techniques used in ballistics analysis include:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><h4>Comparison microscopy</h4></li>
                        <p>This technique employs a comparison microscopeâ€”two separate compound or polarizing light microscopes 
                            connected via a bridge to a single viewing head, allowing an analyst to simultaneously observe two 
                            different samples under the same viewing conditions. Magnifications between 40X and 400X are typically 
                            used.</p>
                        
                        <li><h4>Bullet trajectory analysis</h4></li>
                        <p>Bullet trajectory analysis is critical in regards to determining the path of a bullet and tracing its trajectory.
                            The purpose is to determine approximately where the bullet(s) originated.</p>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Forensic Entomology</h3>
                    <p>Forensic entomology is the study of insects and other arthropods to determine the time of death, location of 
                        death, and other important information in criminal investigations. Techniques used in forensic entomology 
                        include:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><h4>Collection and identification of insect specimens</h4></li>
                      <p>In order for insects to be properly identified and the best control recommendations to be made, the specimens 
                        must be in good condition and at least a minimum amount of collection information provided. Specimens that are 
                        incomplete, damaged, moldy, attached to tape, or squashed can only be identified to general groups. The better 
                        the condition of the specimen, the more precise identification and control recommendations.</p>
                      <li><h4>Analysis of insect life cycles and behavior</h4></li>
                      <p>The appearance of novel climates poses an important challenge for scientists trying to predict the ecological and 
                        evolutionary responses of organisms to climate change. To predict the geographic ranges of species, environmental 
                        niche models (ENMs) depend critically on how different seasonal and diurnal components of temperature and precipitation 
                        are correlated. Anticipated changes in this correlation structure during climate change, and the 
                        need to extrapolate to new environmental conditions, will limit the utility of ENMs for predicting changes in 
                        geographic range or abundance.  </p>
